These files contain sequences used to perform the random search of the MEAs on the variant identification task and benchmarking of the MEAs on the variant identification task. The files are named as follows:

Specifically,
50seqs_synmismatch.pkl contains 50 randomly-generated pairs of on and off-targets, each differing by 1 mismatch. This is used in the random search.
validation_100seqs_synmismatch.pkl contains 100 randomly-generated pairs of on and off-targets, each differing by 1 mismatch. This is used in the benchmarking.
